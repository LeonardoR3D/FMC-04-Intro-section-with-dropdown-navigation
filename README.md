## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was more of an exercise to practice things I already knew but didn't have much practice doing.

### Continued development

I want to get better at using custom properties, I think I have used too many in this project and some of them may not even be necessary.
